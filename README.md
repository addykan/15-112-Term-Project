### 15-112 Term Project F20


Description: This project is a maze crawler designed to be replayed infinitely. The player begins in a maze, fighting enemies and acquiring new powerful weapons and powerups to help them get to the end of the maze. Once the Player has navigated through the maze and eliminated all enemies, they are teleported to a new level, keeping the gear they have acquired. The maze is new and larger, while the enemies have more health and are harder to fight. The goal is to get through as many rooms as possible. This game utilizes Prim's algorithm to generate mazes on demand, which are then populated with objects (weapons, enemies, etc).

To run: To begin, ensure that all files are in the same directory. Then, run
mainGame.py. 

Ensure that PIL and random are installed first. 

There is one shortcut command - press n to move to the next level to see how
difficulty scales.
